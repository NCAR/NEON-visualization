There are several configuration options of CTSM.  This project uses the Community Land Model (CLM) configuration which is the climate and biogeochemistry mode of CTSM. Throughout the rest of this tutorial, we refer to the model as CLM and will use version 5.1 with active biogeochemistry (CLM5.1-BGC). Additional information about CTSM and CLM is available [on the website](https://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/cesm2/land/), including:
-  [technical documentation](https://escomp.github.io/ctsm-docs/versions/release-clm5.0/html/tech_note/index.html),
-  a [user's guide](https://escomp.github.io/ctsm-docs/versions/release-clm5.0/html/users_guide/index.html),
-  and a [quickstart guide](https://escomp.github.io/CESM/release-cesm2/quickstart.html#create-a-case) to running various model configurations 

**Questions about running simulations?** Please post:
- Questions about the CESM-Lab containter on the [Containers & Cloud Platforms forum in the DiscussCESM Forums](https://bb.cgd.ucar.edu/cesm/forums/containers-cloud-platforms.162/). 
- Science related questions on the [CTSM forum in the DiscussCESM Forums](https://bb.cgd.ucar.edu/cesm/forums/ctsm-clm-mosart-rtm.134/).  
Note that this resource will require you to register and log in so that you can be notified of responses to your inquiries.
