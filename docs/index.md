This image shows a comparison of the risks of various options rangding from sheltering in place to evacuating to a local shelter to evacuating to a distant location. Because evacuation by car also poses risks, the best option for this scenario would be for the resident to evacuate to a local shelter." style="display: block; margin: auto;"> -->

<!--banner-description: The goal of the HurricaneRiskCalculator&reg; web app is to provide a localized and personalized assessment of the risks posed by hurricane winds and then to translate this into a form that people can use to make informed decisions about their hurricane preparations. The HurricaneRiskCalculator&reg; web app will be pilot testing in the U.S. and Australia in 2021. To find out how to take part in this pilot, click 'Get Involved' in the menu above.  -->
