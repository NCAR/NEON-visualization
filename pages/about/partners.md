### Government Partners

Many government agencies as well as state and local governments have a strong interest in improving public safety. Several government agencies are partnering with us by having one of their staff or program directors serve as a point of contact either in our Researcher Collective or in our planned Advisory Board. When we have permission to list these agencies, we will do so.
